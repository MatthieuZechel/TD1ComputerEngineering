Hello guys !
I'm back now to tell you how much I love Java. This is the most powerfull language I know and it perfectly fits for class-oriented programming !
I advise you to learn how to code in Java. It's not really difficult because you have very powerfull tools such as Eclipse for programming.
As well as for Git, I can help you and learn you some tips and tricks if you want !
